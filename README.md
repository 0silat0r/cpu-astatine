### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Astatine. 
I'm more into computer engineering than computer software. 
I can say that I am an engineer candidate :)
I am interested in the solution of software and hardware failures, 
maintenance and repair works related to heavy failures caused by 
these failures.
I have intermediate knowledge of 
C, C#, C++, HTML/CSS. 
In my spare time, 
I take walks and read books.

### HTML/CSS || C#  || C++ || C || PYTHON
